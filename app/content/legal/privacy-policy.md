## Privacy Policy

<b>Effective Date: <PrivacyReleaseDate></b>

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to Tasks.app. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application. By accessing or using Tasks.app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

This policy applies to all personal and non-personal data we collect through our platform.

### 2. Information We Collect

We only collect information that you voluntarily submit to us. This may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, task data, and any other personal information you provide.

We do not collect any information about you without your direct input. We do not track your activity outside of Tasks.app, and we do not use third-party cookies. However, we do use **first-party cookies** to store preferences and maintain user sessions within the app.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain the platform.
- Improve, personalize, and expand our services.
- Understand and analyze how you use our application.
- Develop new features and functionality.
- Communicate with you for customer service, updates, and marketing purposes.
- Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve user experience.
- Process transactions and send notifications.
- Detect and prevent fraud or abusive use.

### 4. Error Reporting and User Behavior Analysis

We use third-party tools, such as **Sentry** and **PostHog**, to measure activity and track errors strictly within the app. While we do not control the data handling practices of these third parties, we recommend reviewing their privacy policies. These services may use their own tracking mechanisms and store data in various jurisdictions.

### 5. Data Retention

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, unless a longer retention period is required by law. If your account becomes inactive or is terminated, your data may be deleted in accordance with our data retention policies.

### 6. International Data Transfers

By using our services, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than your own. This includes countries where our third-party service providers, such as Sentry and PostHog, operate, such as the United States.

We operate on a **global compute platform**, which may serve and store content from/to various countries across the globe. Currently, our **compute and databases are primarily located in Brazil**. We do not offer the option for users to customize where their data is handled or stored.

### 7. Security Measures

We implement various security measures to protect your data, including encryption, access controls, and secure storage systems. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 8. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your data to third parties. We may share your data with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the platform or with authorities when legally required.

We may share non-personal identifiers, such as randomly generated user IDs, with third parties to assist with our operations, such as payment processing through Stripe. Workspace names may also be shared, but we will not share personally identifiable information without your consent, except when required by law.

### 9. User Rights

You have the right to:

- Request access to your personal data.
- Request corrections or deletions of your personal data.
- Object to the processing of your personal data.
- Request the transfer of your data to another service provider (data portability).

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at rifling_06_valiant@icloud.com.

### 10. Children's Privacy

Tasks.app does not knowingly store personal information from individuals under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a user under this age, we will take steps to delete that information.

### 11. Updates to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If material changes are made, we will notify you via email or through prominent notices within the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
