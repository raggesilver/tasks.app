Welcome to Tasks.app. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application. By accessing or using Tasks.app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

We only collect information that you voluntarily submit to us. This may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, task data, and any other personal information you provide.

We do not collect any information about you without your direct input, and we do not track your activity outside of Tasks.app. We do not use third-party cookies or sell your data to third parties.

## 4. Error Reporting and User Behavior Analysis

We may use third-party tools, such as (but not limited to) Sentry and PostHog, to measure activity and track errors. While these tools help us improve the platform by analyzing errors, product usage, and user behavior strictly within the app, we have no control over what these tools might do. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services.

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or other purposes. However, if required by law, we will disclose your information to the relevant authorities. This will only be done if a legal request is made by a government body.
