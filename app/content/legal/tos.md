## 5. Free Tier Commitment and Pricing Changes

Tasks.app will always offer a free tier of service. While we may introduce premium features in the future, the basic functionality will remain free to users.

### 5.1 Workspaces, Boards, Collaborators, and Plans

- **Workspace:** A workspace is a logical grouping of boards, labels, and collaborators.
- **Board:** A board is a logical grouping of tasks within a workspace.
- **Collaborator:** A collaborator is a user that has access to a workspace with full or limited permissions to view and/or modify data within the workspace.
- **Plan:** A plan is a set of limits and permissions that apply to a single workspace.

### 5.2 Paid Features and Plans

From **RELEASE_DATE** onwards, Tasks.app will introduce a new paid feature related to **file uploads**. This feature incurs a cost to provide, and as such, it will be part of the platform’s first paid plan.

- All users will have a "Personal" workspace created for them on **RELEASE_DATE**, and all existing boards will be transferred to the owner's personal workspace.
- Each workspace will be assigned to a **Free Plan** by default.
- The **Free Plan** will have certain limitations on file uploads and other premium features.
- Paid plans will be introduced to provide additional resources such as higher file upload limits, additional collaborators, and more advanced features.

No resources created or used before **RELEASE_DATE** will be deleted or restricted. Users who previously enjoyed unrestricted usage will retain access to their existing data, but new usage may be subject to plan limitations.

## 6. Payments and Subscriptions

Tasks.app uses **Stripe** as its payment processor for all paid plans. All payment processing and validation is handled by Stripe, and no credit card information is stored by Tasks.app. Stripe may not be available in all countries, which may limit the availability of paid plans for users in certain regions.

### 6.1 Payment Terms

- By signing up for a paid plan, you agree to provide accurate and complete payment information.
- Stripe will handle all transactions securely and in compliance with industry standards. We recommend that you carefully review Stripe’s [Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) before signing up.

### 6.2 Payment Failure and Downgrades

- If a payment fails or is not fulfilled on time, your access to premium features will be **restricted for one month**.
- If the payment remains unfulfilled by the end of the second month, your workspace will be forcibly downgraded to a **Free Plan**.
- After a forced downgrade, all excess usage will be **deleted permanently**.

### 6.3 Plans and Pricing Changes

The details of the available plans, including their limits, are listed on our **pricing page**. Users will be notified of any plan or pricing changes **30 days before** they take effect.

### 6.4 Data Handling and Download

Tasks.app currently does not offer a "Download My Data" option. However, once this feature is available, it will be provided **free of charge** and will not be restricted behind a paywall. Users will have the ability to download their data between the one- and two-month notice periods if payments are not completed.

### 6.5 User Identification with Stripe

Tasks.app may share certain non-personal identifiers with Stripe to link users within Tasks.app, including randomly generated user IDs. Workspace names may also be shared, but no personally identifiable information (PII) will be shared with Stripe.
